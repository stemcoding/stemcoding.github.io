Use your knowledge of programming, linear functions and trigonometry to protect an airport from drones. Similar to an old Atari game called missile command

Hopefully you completed [Laser Defense (The Basic Game)](laser1.qmd) and were able to add a laser to a simple code to damage an incoming drone. In this activity we are going to add code to catch the drone after it falls (explained in a moment). We are also going to add code to automate the targeting of the drone.

Airport security is really happy with what you've done. The only problem is that when the drones hit the ground they are so mangled that it is hard to figure out who owns it or where it came from. They designed a rolling platform with a net to catch the drone before it can hit the ground. That is going to be a new challenge for the game. Ideally, there would be an automated system to catch the falling drone, so that is something to think about.

The other change in this activity is that we are going to use the arrow keys to change the angle of the laser instead of the x,y position of the focus. This is a bit more realistic. This also makes the game a bit harder. Later in the activity we will add code to automatically aim the laser at the drone so it is easier to damage the drones that are encroaching on our airspace.
