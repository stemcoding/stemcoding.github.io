Play a video game to learn about viruses and epidemics

## About the activity

WE DID NOT CREATE THIS ACTIVITY!!! It was originally created by Prof. Marcel Salathe and collaborators at a Swiss university called ETH Zurich. Prof. Salathe and others study how diseases spread as a kind of mathematical problem (in other words they study a field called "epidemiology"). They originally created this game in 2013 and it worked great for a while but by 2022, it had stopped working. Thankfully they released their source code on <a href="https://github.com/digitalepidemiologylab/VaxGame/">github</a>. Individuals associated with STEMcoding were able to simplify the code and get it running again.
