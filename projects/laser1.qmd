Drones have become cheaper and cheaper which is increasingly a problem at airports because people sometimes fly them in the airspace near the planes. If a plane wre to run into a drone, bad things could happen

There are not a ton of choices to take down drones that wander into the air space of an airport. One could try to snare the drone with a net, but that can be complicated. One could try to shoot it down with a machine gun, but the bullets that miss eventually land somewhere.

A promising option is to use a laser to shoot down the drone. Right now the technology is primarily used by the military but eventually it will be something that civilian airports can use.

In this activity we will consider drones that are moving in a straight line ner an air port. We will need to aim a laser system at the drone and get the focusing of the laser right to shoot down the drone. If we are pointing in the right direction, but the focal point is off then the intensity of the light won't be high enough to damage the drone. This is a real effect.
