## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson students will...

* Explain how force and acceleration are related using visual evidence from the game.
* Understand how a charged particle's motion is affected by its mass and charge while in an electric field.
* Analyze the situation to calculate the final velocity of a particle after being immersed in an electric field.
