If you have finished tinkering with the Planetoids lab you can continue with this lab where we will now add gravity to the game! You have a little ship that you must fly around and land safely on the moon. If you approach the landing too fast you will crash the ship.

## Learning Objecties
At the end of this lesson students will...

* Apply kinematic equations to code a ships descent through a gravitational field.
* Apply Newtonâ€™s laws of motion to code how an object behaves under different force conditions.
* Apply gravitational field strength to the base planetoids game.
* Evaluate the free fall time displayed on the simulation for realism.
