Play a video game to learn about viruses and epidemics

## About the Activity

WE DID NOT CREATE THIS ACTIVITY!!! It was originally created by a Ph.D. student named Ellsworth Campbell and other collaborators of Prof. Marcel Salathe. The creators of this activity this interactive study how diseases spread as a kind of mathematical problem (in other words they study a field called "epidemiology").

They originally created this game in 2013 and it worked great for a while but by 2022, it had stopped working. Thankfully they released their source code on <a href="https://github.com/digitalepidemiologylab/VaxGame/">github</a>. Individuals associated with STEMcoding were able to simplify the code and get it working again so that it no longer requires a server to run it.
