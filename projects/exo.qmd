## Activity Introduction

Hopefully you completed the Slingshot with Gravity! coding activity. (If you completed the Escape Velocity / Newtonian Black Holes activity that's great, but it's NOT a requirement for working on this activity.) The Slingshot with Gravity! activity explores the behavior of objects like planets or comets interacting with a massive object like the sun. An interesting part of that activity is showing that the gravitational force between two objects is inversely proportional to the distance squared. We found that this must be true:

$$F_{grav}=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$

and we have this formula instead of something proportional to $1/r^n$ because the planets are observed to have elliptical orbits and as the coding activity shows you only get elliptical orbits if n=2.

In THIS activity we are going to keep using this formula but instead of keeping one object fixed (the sun) and letting the other move around it we are going to let BOTH objects move and see what happens.

Letting both objects move is important, because many of the extra-solar planets (a.k.a. exoplanets) that we know about we only discovered because of the motion of the star that they are orbiting! So we will talk about the little white circle as a planet orbiting the sun instead of being something much smaller, like a comet or a satellite.
