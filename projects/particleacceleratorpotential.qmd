After completing Particle Accelerator, check out this activity where we consider what happens if the "Electric Potential" is kept the same even as we change the Electric field and the separation between the plates

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson students will...

* Understand that electric potential can appropriately model how electric fields affect charged particles.
* Understand how a charged particle's motion is affected by the electric potential of a field.
* Analyze the situation to calculate the final velocity of a particle after experiencing an electric field using electric potential relationships.
