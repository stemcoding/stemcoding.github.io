This programming lab is a continuation of the [accelerator programming lab](particleacclerator.qmd) where a proton is accelerated from the electric field between two charged plates. The only difference between the earlier programming lab and this programming labis that we are going to think about the potential difference between the two charged plates.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson students will...

* Understand that electric potential can appropriately model how electric fields affect charged particles.
* Understand how a charged particle's motion is affected by the electric potential of a field.
* Analyze the situation to calculate the final velocity of a particle after experiencing an electric field using electric potential relationships.
