This programming lab is designed to illustrate the idea of wave interference. This happens because of the principle of "superposition". For sound waves, this 20 dollar word just means that if there are two speakers in a large room or open space, the amplitude of the sound waves at a particular point in that room are the sum of the waves of the two speakers.

* [Wave Interference Code Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/ChrisOrban/sketches/rkMi3KSQ-)

## Learning Objectives
 By the end of this activity students willâ€¦

* Understand how wave interference affects the observed volume at various locations in a room.
* Create a simulation to observe where waves have constructive and destructive interference in a room with two speakers.
