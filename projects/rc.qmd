This programming lab is unlike the previous ones in that it involves circuits. Specifically it involves circuits with a battery, a capacitor and one or two resistors.

## Links to Activity
* [Instructions for RC Circuits](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/orban.14//stemcoding/RCcircuit/RCcircuits.html)
* [RC Circuits Code Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/ChrisOrban/sketches/HkslU7UAQ)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson students will...

* Apply Ohmâ€™s law to code a RC circuit so it behaves in a physically accurate way.
* Evaluate how changing various values of a circuit (Capacitance, resistance) affects the dissipation time of a capacitor.
