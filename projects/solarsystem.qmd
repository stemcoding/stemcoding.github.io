Use a spreadsheet to design a model solar system

## Instructions

An important spreadsheet skill is to [multiply the values in a particular column by a constant and have the result appear in the next column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRzfHcgDvyk). Using $ in a spreadsheet can be helpful for this as discussed in the link.  A situation where this is required is if you are making a scale model.

<b>Imagine that your town or school has asked you to design a solar system model.</b>

<b>Step 1.</b> Decide how big your solar system model will be. For example, you can choose a football field, basketball court, classroom, a long straight sidewalk, etc. Each group should choose something different.

[Download this CSV file with the planets and their distances to the sun and open it in a spreadsheet program](../solar_system.csv)

<b>Note:</b> This CSV file uses solar system data from this [NASA website](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/planet_table_ratio.html)

<b>Step 2.</b> Configure columnn C in the spreadsheet so that it takes the distance in column B and divides it by the scale (Advice: [This youtube video that was mentioned earlier is helpful for this task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRzfHcgDvyk) )

<b>Step 3.</b> Change the scale to make sure that the model distance to Pluto is roughly the same as your solar system model (Advice: the scale should be <b>much</b> larger than 1)

## Optional Extensions

1. Ask the students to go and construct the model solar system. For example, use chalk to mark the planets on a sidewalk, or different sized balls on a basketball court or some other sports field, or go smaller with making the  solar system model in a hallway or inside the classroom, or mark the planets on a meter stick, etc.

2. Take the project a step further and use the same scale to determine the diameter of the balls in the model. You can find the diameter of each planet from [these](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/)  [links](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/planet_table_ratio.html). Which sized balls should be used for which planets?
