If you liked the Pong activity you'll love this activity which is based on a real game called Bonk.io

One of the most popular and entertaining .io games out there right now is bonk.io If you've not played it you should definitely check it out. The game is pretty simple. You're a little ball and you bounce off the ground and various objects. You have some ability to affect your motion, but if you get bounced by some object or some other player so that you fly off the board you lose the game. It's a little bit like sumo wrestling that way.
