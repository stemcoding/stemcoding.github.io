It turns out nearly all smartphones (iPhones and Android models) and
nearly all iPads have air pressure sensors (a.k.a. barometers). There are
a couple of apps you can use to get a pressure reading but the one that
seems to work best on all platforms is the Arduino Science Journal app. The goal of this activity is to use the air pressure sensor in a smartphone to collect pressure data at different heights and compare the data to known physical models.
