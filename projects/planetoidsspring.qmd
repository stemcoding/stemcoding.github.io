Think back to the momentum exercise. The little ship can collide with a "blob" and stick to it. Now imagine that this blob is attached to a spring. Wouldn't it be interesting if the ship could collide with the blob and then the spring would push and pull both around? This is what we will do in this exercise.

* [Planetoids with a Spring Code Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/ChrisOrban/sketches/BJm9lxHC7)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson students will...

* Apply Hooke’s Law, Newton’s 2nd Law, and constant acceleration kinematic equations to code a blob on a spring to behave appropriately when it is collided by a spaceship.
* Evaluate the theoretical half-cycle time of the coded spring.
* Create a code which accounts for the dampening effect of the spring with time.
