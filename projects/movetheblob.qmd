On the internet there are some fun games where you control a circle-looking-thing that you can move around and interact (and potentially destroy or absorb!) other circle-looking things controlled by other people. Two games that come to mind are diep.io and agar.io. There are plenty of others like them out there

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this lesson students will...
