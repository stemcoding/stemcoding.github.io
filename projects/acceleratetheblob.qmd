In real life, objects accelerate up to a particlar velocity. This exercise will show you how to modify the move the blob exercise so that the blob accelerates in response to the arrow keys, instead of the arrow keys directly controlling the velocity.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson students will...

* Understand basic p5.js syntax, specifically the difference between “+=” and “=”.
* Compare and contrast acceleration and velocity pertaining to objects moving along a straight line path.
* Analyze an object's motion using multiple representations, specifically graphical, pictorial, vector, and algebraic.
