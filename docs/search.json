We call this game Bellicose Birds.\nFrom a physics perspective, bellicose birds is essentially the same as lunar descent except that there is no rocket thrust. The kinematic equations look like this: \\[\\sum F_{\\rm{net},x} = 0 = m \\, a_x\\] \\[\\sum F_{\\rm{net},y} = - m g = m \\, a_y\\] \\[ \\Delta v_x = a_x \\Delta t\\] \\[ \\Delta v_y = a_y \\Delta t\\] \\[ v_x = v_{x0} + \\Delta v_x\\] \\[ v_y = v_{y0} + \\Delta v_y\\] \\[ x = x_0 + v_x \\cdot \\Delta t \\] \\[ y = y_0 + v_y \\cdot \\Delta t \\]\nThe computer program we will work with here computes these equations over and over again, updating \\(v_x\\), \\(v_y\\), \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) depending on whether the thrust is turned on or off. If the thrust is turned off then \\(a_x = 0\\) and \\(\\Delta v_x = 0\\) and the ship just continues with the same \\(v_x\\) velocity. With the thrust off the \\(v_y\\) velocity will continue to change with time due to gravity, \\(\\Delta v_y = -g \\, \\Delta t\\)."

In particular, we want to know how fast you have to be going to escape the earth’s gravitational field. We are also going to think about energy conservation and what it means for an object to be gravitationally “bound” by a massive orbit or not. These are all topics we dind’t get to in the Slingshot with Gravity activity."

So we will talk about the little white circle as a planet orbiting the sun instead of being something much smaller, like a comet or a satellite."

The game is pretty simple. You’re a little ball and you bounce off the ground and various objects. You have some ability to affect your motion, but if you get bounced by some object or some other player so that you fly off the board you lose the game. It’s a little bit like sumo wrestling that way.\nHere is the (video) game plan: (1) Add gravity to the pong game. (2) Add horizontal forces that are controlled by the left and right arrow keys. (3) Optional Challenge #1: Add a game over, (4) Optional challenge #2: Add vertical forces (besides gravity) that are controlled by the up and down arrow keys. (5) Have fun!"

    "text": "Activity Introduction\nIn this course we typically think in meters. In the programming labs, the x and y variables are actually in pixel units and the width of the screen is 750 pixels. For example, if the position of the object (x) is less than zero or larger than 750, the object will move off of the screen. Typically the height of the screen is 500. If the vertical position of the object (y) is less than zero or larger than 500 the object will move off the screen.\nHow do we relate pixels to the typical meter units that we use in class? We have some options!\nWe could figure out how large each pixel actually is on your screen in meters and then multiply the x and y positions by this size. This involves a lot of multiplying and a lot of confusion about whether we are talking about meters or pixels. For example, we would have to multiply all the velocities by the pixel size to change the units from pixels per second to meters per second, and the same thing for the acceleration (to change it from pixels per second2 to meters per second2). Everyone’s screen will have a slightly different pixel size. What a mess!\nThe simpler thing is to just think of pixels as meters and talk about velocities as meters per second and accelerations as meters per second squared. There is no harm in doing this! It just means that the screen (with the particle being accelerated between two plates) is showing something that is much larger than what actually appears on the screen. Since the screen is 750 pixels across, this means that you are looking down on something that is really 7.5 soccer fields across. This is a little bit weird to imagine but it is a lot simpler than the alternative."
