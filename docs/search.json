For example, Wilmington, Ohio is USM00072426 and Amarillo, Texas is USM00072363. To find a weather station near you, look through this list of US station names with recent data. If you can’t find your city there you may be able to find it in the full list however note that for some cities the latest data available could be decades old which could be a problem because there may not be a height estimate for each pressure reading\nLook for the data for your station on https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/integrated-global-radiosonde-archive/access/data-y2d/ You will find a zip file with the name of the station (for example: USM00072363-data-beg2025.txt.zip) Download that file and figure out a way to unzip or extract the file so that it looks like USM00072363-data.txt This file contains many ballon measurements at that location. You only need one measurement!\nHere is what one measurement of pressure versus height looks like\n\n#USM00072363 2025 01 01 00 2306  324 ncdc-nws ncdc-gts  352331 -1017091\n21     0  89482B 1095    67B  420   120    92    15 \n20     7  89005  1139B   60B  362   138    40    29 \n20    20  88282  1204B   50B  387   129    59    26 \n20    28  87861  1244B   46B  397   125    60    26 \n20    45  86986  1325B   37B  418   117    83    26 \n20   105  85891  1428B   27B  440   110    65    16 \n20   121  85123  1500B   20B  457   104    70    19 \n10   123  85000  1512B   19B  460   103    70    20 \n20   203  82901  1714B    0B  504    90   180    29 \n20   205  82763  1727B   -1B  507    89   185    30 \n20   220  82001  1800B   -8B  527    84   179    14 \n20   245  80633  1934B  -22B  564    75   109    17 \n20   311  78968  2100B  -37B  610    64   136    31 \n20   325  78244  2172B  -43B  633    59   153    26 \n20   355  76772  2322B  -56B  668    52   179    28 \n20   514  72790  2738B  -71B  471    93   241    92 \n20   529  72108  2811B  -70B  449    99   250   111 \n20   543  71538  2873B  -71B  467    94   256   127 \n10   615  70000  3043B  -39B  425   108   273   150 \n20   621  69732  3074B  -39B  411   112   275   151 \n20   645  68604  3202B  -44B  360   127   279   174 \n20   705  67608  3317B  -47B  314   143   273   217 \n20   717  67080  3379B  -49B  306   146   274   225 \n20   745  65870  3522B  -56B  338   133   279   234 \n20   805  65015  3624B  -64B  355   127   279   216 \n20   824  64302  3710B  -70B  363   124   278   212 \n20   845  63357  3823B  -74B  344   129   276   210 \n20   917  61972  3997B  -81B  279   152   271   225 \n20   925  61636  4039B  -84B  283   150   270   230 \n20   953  60378  4200B  -92B  323   134   273   250 \n20   957  60206  4222B  -94B  326   133   274   251 \n20  1037  58461  4447B  -99B  150   216   281   299 \n20  1105  57281  4605B -106B  158   192   283   352 \n20  1125  56540  4705B -113B  124   214   283   377 \n20  1145  55859  4798B -121B  100   232   281   375 \n20  1225  54432  4995B -136B   72   260   284   387 \n20  1305  52862  5217B -146B   13   401   287   365 \n20  1318  52448  5276B -151B   12   402   286   364 \n............Many more lines of data!!!.............\n20  9705   1100 30177B -500B   11   315    32    85 \n20  9725   1079 30305B -499B   11   316    25    96 \n20  9805   1038 30557B -494B   10   319    50    86 \n10  9843   1000 30804B -490B   10   321    43    83 \n20  9845    998 30817B -490B   10   321    42    82 \n20  9905    978 30948B -488B   10   321    51    81 \n20  9945    939 31214B -486B   10   321    34   103 \n20 10005    921 31344B -487B   11   320    28   101 \n20 10025    902 31481B -486B   10   320    30    91 \n20 10105    867 31744B -486B   10   320    49    88 \n20 10125    849 31882B -485B   11   319    36    82 \n20 10127    847 31894B -485B   11   319    35    83 \n20 10147    830 32030B -485B   11   319    22    91 \n20 10221    807 32249B -486B   10   320    20    93 \n30 -9999  -9999  1200 -9999 -9999 -9999    60    26 \n30 -9999  -9999  1500 -9999 -9999 -9999    65    15 \n30 -9999  -9999  1800 -9999 -9999 -9999   185    15 \n30 -9999  -9999  2100 -9999 -9999 -9999   135    36 \n30 -9999  -9999  2400 -9999 -9999 -9999   185    26 \n30 -9999  -9999  2700 -9999 -9999 -9999   235    82 \n30 -9999  -9999  3300 -9999 -9999 -9999   275   216 \n30 -9999  -9999  3600 -9999 -9999 -9999   280   221 \n30 -9999  -9999  3900 -9999 -9999 -9999   270   231 \n30 -9999  -9999  4200 -9999 -9999 -9999   275   247 \n30 -9999  -9999  4500 -9999 -9999 -9999   285   350 \n30 -9999  -9999  4800 -9999 -9999 -9999   280   376 \n\nWe need to extract the third and fourth columns in order to plot the pressure versus height but this is a messy dataset that needs to be cleaned!

    "section": "",
    "text": "This activity involves taking the code at the end of the Slingshot with Gravity exercise and doing some experiments with that code to learn more about the special properties of objects that are experiencing the gravitational pull from a central object. This central object can be a star or a black hole or a neutron star, etc. and the object in orbit can be a comet or an asteroid or a space capsule or even a whole planet. Usually this topic is connected to discussions of the motion of planets around a star.\nKepler made a number of important discoveries about the motion of the planets in the solar system. In the Slingshot with Gravity activity we created a code that demonstrated that 1/r2 forces like gravity naturally produce elliptical orbits. Hopefully you played around with that code to try to see if you could make orbits other than an ellipse. It turns out that as long as the object does not have enough kinetic energy to totally escape the gravitational field of the star it will produce some kind of elliptical orbit. Not only will the trajectory be an ellipse, the object will follow this same path every time it moves around the star. This result is often referred to as Kepler’s first law. Kepler was an astronomer who looked closely at the orbits of planets like Venus and Mars.\nIn this activity we will consider Kepler’s second law. Kepler’s second law has to do with how quickly the planet moves in its elliptical orbit. Kepler showed that the area that the planet “sweeps out” over some interval of time is the same regardless what part of the orbit the planet is in. If you’ve never heard of Kepler’s laws the sentence you just read about planets sweeping things out will probably not make much sense"

    "text": "Use your knowledge of programming and linear functions to protect an airport from drones. Similar to an old Atari game galled missle command.\nDrones have become cheaper and cheaper which is increasingly a problem at airports because people sometimes fly them in the airspace near the planes. If a plane wre to run into a drone, bad things could happen\nThere are not a ton of choices to take down drones that wander into the air space of an airport. One could try to snare the drone with a net, but that can be complicated. One could try to shoot it down with a machine gun, but the bullets that miss eventually land somewhere.\nA promising option is to use a laser to shoot down the drone. Right now the technology is primarily used by the military but eventually it will be something that civilian airports can use.\nIn this activity we will consider drones that are moving in a straight line ner an air port. We will need to aim a laser system at the drone and get the focusing of the laser right to shoot down the drone. If we are pointing in the right direction, but the focal point is off then the intensity of the light won’t be high enough to damage the drone. This is a real effect."

Any miscalculation could send the mercury capsule hundreds of miles from where the Navy was expecting to recover the spacecraft and the astronaut inside.\nThe calculation that Katherine Johnson did had to consider many different effects on the trajectory of the mercury capsule. For this activity we are going to keep it simple and start with putting the capsule in a circular orbit. In the second part, we will consider how the mercury capsule comes back to earth. This part of the space mission is referred to as “re-entry”."

    "text": "A Note on Cross-platform Operability\nBy default, most coding and statistical environments expect UNIX-style line endings (ASCII LF character) as representing line breaks. However, Windows uses an alternate line ending signifier (ASCII CR LF characters) by default for legacy compatibility with Teletype-based systems.\nAs such, when exporting to CSV using Excel, your data in text format will look like this:\ndata1,data21,24,5\nWhen opening your CSV file in Excel again, it will parse it as follows:\n\nHowever, if you open your CSV file on a different system that does not parse the CR character it will interpret your CSV file differently:\nYour data in text format then look like this:\ndata1\ndata2\n1\n2\n...\nYou will then see a weird character or possibly the string CR or \\r:\n\nthus causing terrible things to happen to your data. For example, 2\\r is not a valid integer, and thus will throw an error (if you’re lucky) when you attempt to operate on it in R or Python. Note that this happens on Excel for OSX as well as Windows, due to legacy Windows compatibility.\nThere are a handful of solutions for enforcing uniform UNIX-style line endings on your exported CSV files:\nWhen exporting from Excel, save as a “Windows comma separated (.csv)” file\n\nA note on R and .xlsx\nThere are R packages that can read .xls or .xlsx files (as well as Google spreadsheets). It is even possible to access different worksheets in the .xlsx documents.\nBut\n\nsome of these only work on Windows\nthis equates to replacing a (simple but manual) export to csv with additional complexity/dependencies in the data analysis R code\ndata formatting best practice still apply\nIs there really a good reason why csv (or similar) is not adequate?\n\n\n\nCaveats on commas\nIn some datasets, the data values themselves may include commas (,). This is particularly true in countries that use commas as decimal separators. In that case, the software which you use (including Excel) will most likely incorrectly display the data in columns. This is because the commas which are a part of the data values will be interpreted as delimiters.\nIf you are working with data that contains commas, you likely will need to use another delimiter when working in a spreadsheet. In this case, consider using tabs as your delimiter and working with TSV files. TSV files can be exported from spreadsheet programs in the same way as CSV files. For more of a discussion on data formats and potential issues with commas within datasets see the discussion page."

    "text": "Good data organization is the foundation of any research project. Most researchers have data in spreadsheets, so it’s the place that many research projects start.\nWe organize data in spreadsheets in the ways that we as humans want to work with the data, but computers require that data be organized in particular ways. In order to use tools that make computation more efficient, such as programming languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data the way that computers need the data. Since this is where most research projects start, this is where we want to start too!\nIn this lesson, you will learn:\nIn this lesson, however, you will not learn about data analysis with spreadsheets. Much of your time as a researcher will be spent in the initial ‘data wrangling’ stage, where you need to organize the data to perform a proper analysis later. It’s not the most fun, but it is necessary. In this lesson you will learn how to think about data organization and some practices for more effective data wrangling. With this approach you can better format current data and plan new data collection so less data wrangling is needed."

    "section": "Quality Assurance",
    "text": "Quality Assurance\nQuality assurance stops bad data from ever being entered by checking to see if values are valid during data entry. For example, if research is being conducted at sites A, B, and C, then the value V (which is right next to B on the keyboard) should never be entered. Likewise if one of the kinds of data being collected is a count, only integers greater than or equal to zero should be allowed.\nTo control the kind of data entered into a spreadsheet we use Data Validation (Excel) or Validity (Libre Office Calc), to set the values that can be entered in each data column.\n\nSelect the cells or column you want to validate\nOn the Data tab select Data Validation\n\n\n\nIn the Allow box select the kind of data that should be in the column. Options include whole numbers, decimals, lists of items, dates, and other values.\n\n\n\nAfter selecting an item enter any additional details. For example, if you’ve chosen a list of values, enter a comma-delimited or semi-colon list of allowable values in the Source box.\n\nLet’s try this out by setting the plot column in our spreadsheet to only allow plot values that are integers between 1 and 24.\n\nSelect the 1plot_id1 column\nOn the Data tab select Data Validation\nIn the Allow box select Whole number\nSet the minimum and maximum values to 1 and 24.\n\n\nNow let’s try entering a new value in the plot column that isn’t a valid plot. The spreadsheet stops us from entering the wrong value and asks us if we would like to try again.\n\nYou can also customize the resulting message to be more informative by entering your own message in the Input Message tab\n\nor allow invalid data to result in a warning rather than an error by modifying the Style option on the Error Alert tab.\n\nQuality assurance can make data entry easier as well as more robust. For example, if you use a list of options to restrict data entry, the spreadsheet will provide you with a drop-downlist of the available items. So, instead of trying to remember how to spell Dipodomys spectabilis, you can select the right option from the list."

Create a separate file with appropriate naming and versioning, and ensure your data is stored as values and not as formulas. Because formulas refer to other cells, and you may be moving cells around, you may compromise the integrity of your data if you do not take this step!\nreadMe (README) files: As you start manipulating your data files, create a readMe document / text file to keep track of your files and document your manipulations so that they may be easily understood and replicated, either by your future self or by an independent researcher. Your readMe file should document all of the files in your data set (including documentation), describe their content and format, and lay out the organizing principles of folders and subfolders. For each of the separate files listed, it is a good idea to document the manipulations or analyses that were carried out on those data.

Sort your data by each field, one at a time. Scan through each column, but pay the most attention to the top and the bottom of a column. If your dataset is well-structured and does not contain formulas, sorting should never affect the integrity of your dataset.\nRemember to expand your sort in order to prevent data corruption. Expanding your sort ensures that the all the data in one row move together instead of only sorting a single column in isolation.

If you are aware of the errors and the possible negative effect on downstream data analysis and result interpretation, it might motivate yourself and your project members to try and avoid them. Making small changes to the way you format your data in spreadsheets can have a great impact on efficiency and reliability when it comes to data cleaning and analysis.\n\nUsing multiple tables\nUsing multiple tabs\nNot filling in zeros\nUsing problematic null values\nUsing formatting to convey information\nUsing formatting to make the data sheet look pretty\nPlacing comments or units in cells\nEntering more than one piece of information in a cell\nUsing problematic field names\nUsing special characters in data\nInclusion of metadata in data table\nDate formatting\n\n##Using multiple tables\nA common strategy is creating multiple data tables within one spreadsheet. This confuses the computer, so don’t do this! When you create multiple tables within one spreadsheet, you’re drawing false associations between things for the computer, which sees each row as an observation. You’re also potentially using the same field name in multiple places, which will make it harder to clean your data up into a usable form. The example below depicts the problem:\n\n\n\nmultiple tabs\n\n\nIn the example above, the computer will see (for example) row 4 and assume that all columns A-AF refer to the same sample. This row actually represents four distinct samples (sample 1 for each of four different collection dates - May 29th, June 12th, June 19th, and June 26th), as well as some calculated summary statistics (an average (avr) and standard error of measurement (SEM)) for two of those samples. Other rows are similarly problematic."

    "title": "Formatting problems",
    "section": "Using multiple tabs",
    "text": "Using multiple tabs\nBut what about workbook tabs? That seems like an easy way to organize data, right? Well, yes and no. When you create extra tabs, you fail to allow the computer to see connections in the data that are there (you have to introduce spreadsheet application-specific functions or scripting to ensure this connection). Say, for instance, you make a separate tab for each day you take a measurement.\nThis isn’t good practice for two reasons: 1) you are more likely to accidentally add inconsistencies to your data if each time you take a measurement, you start recording data in a new tab, and 2) even if you manage to prevent all inconsistencies from creeping in, you will add an extra step for yourself before you analyze the data because you will have to combine these data into a single datatable. You will have to explicitly tell the computer how to combine tabs - and if the tabs are inconsistently formatted, you might even have to do it manually.\nThe next time you’re entering data, and you go to create another tab or table, ask yourself if you could avoid adding this tab by adding another column to your original spreadsheet. We used multiple tabs in our example of a messy data file, but now you’ve seen how you can reorganize your data to consolidate across tabs.\nYour data sheet might get very long over the course of the experiment. This makes it harder to enter data if you can’t see your headers at the top of the spreadsheet. But don’t repeat your header row. These can easily get mixed into the data, leading to problems down the road.\nInstead you can freeze the column headers so that they remain visible even when you have a spreadsheet with many rows.\nDocumentation on how to freeze column headers in MS Excel"

    "text": "Not filling in zeros\nIt might be that when you’re measuring something, it’s usually a zero, say the number of times a rabbit is observed in the survey. Why bother writing in the number zero in that column, when it’s mostly zeros?\nHowever, there’s a difference between a zero and a blank cell in a spreadsheet. To the computer, a zero is actually data. You measured or counted it. A blank cell means that it wasn’t measured and the computer will interpret it as an unknown value (otherwise known as a null value).\nThe spreadsheets or statistical programs will likely mis-interpret blank cells that you intend to be zeros. By not entering the value of your observation, you are telling your computer to represent that data as unknown or missing (null). This can cause problems with subsequent calculations or analyses. For example, the average of a set of numbers which includes a single null value is always null (because the computer can’t guess the value of the missing observations). Because of this, it’s very important to record zeros as zeros and truly missing data as nulls."

    "text": "Using problematic null values\nExample: using -999 or other numerical values (or zero) to represent missing data.\nSolutions:\nThere are a few reasons why null values get represented differently within a dataset. Sometimes confusing null values are automatically recorded from the measuring device. If that’s the case, there’s not much you can do, but it can be addressed in data cleaning with a tool like OpenRefine before analysis. Other times different null values are used to convey different reasons why the data isn’t there. This is important information to capture, but is in effect using one column to capture two pieces of information. Like for using formatting to convey information it would be good here to create a new column like ‘data_missing’ and use that column to capture the different reasons.\nWhatever the reason, it’s a problem if unknown or missing data is recorded as -999, 999, or 0. Many statistical programs will not recognize that these are intended to represent missing (null) values. How these values are interpreted will depend on the software you use to analyze your data. It is essential to use a clearly defined and consistent null indicator. Blanks (most applications) and NA (for R) are good choices. White et al, 2013, explain good choices for indicating null values for different software applications in their article: Nine simple ways to make it easier to (re)use your data."

Also, when copying data in from applications such as Word, formatting and fancy non-standard characters (such as left- and right-aligned quotation marks) are included. When exporting this data into a coding/statistical environment or into a relational database, dangerous things may occur, such as lines being cut in half and encoding errors being thrown.\nGeneral best practice is to avoid adding characters such as newlines, tabs, and vertical tabs.

You may be on intimate terms with your dataset while you are collecting and analysing it, but the chances that you will still remember that the variable “sglmemgp” means single member of group, for example, or the exact algorithm you used to transform a variable or create a derived one, after a few months, a year, or more are slim.\nAs well, there are many reasons other people may want to examine or use your data - to understand your findings, to verify your findings, to review your submitted publication, to replicate your results, to design a similar study, or even to archive your data for access and re-use by others. While digital data by definition are machine-readable, understanding their meaning is a job for human beings. The importance of documenting your data during the collection and analysis phase of your research cannot be overestimated, especially if your research is going to be part of the scholarly record.\nHowever, metadata should not be contained in the data file itself. Unlike a table in a paper or a supplemental file, metadata (in the form of legends) should not be included in a data file since this information is not data, and including it can disrupt how computer programs interpret your data file. Rather, metadata should be stored as a separate file in the same directory as your data file, preferably in plain text format with a name that clearly associates it with your data file. Because metadata files are free text format, they also allow you to encode comments, units, information about how null values are encoded, etc. that are important to document but can disrupt the formatting of your data file.\nAdditionally, file or database level metadata describes how files that make up the dataset relate to each other; what format are they are in; and whether they supercede or are superceded by previous files. A folder-level readme.txt file is the classic way of accounting for all the files and folders in a project.\n(Text on metadata adapted from the online course Research Data MANTRA by EDINA and Data Library, University of Edinburgh.

    "text": "Structuring data in spreadsheets\nThe cardinal rule of using spreadsheet programs for data is to keep it “tidy”:\nPut all your variables in columns - the thing you’re measuring, like ‘weight’ or ‘temperature’. Put each observation in its own row. Don’t combine multiple pieces of information in one cell. Sometimes it just seems like one thing, but think if that’s the only way you’ll want to be able to use or sort that data. Leave the raw data raw - don’t change it! Export the cleaned data to a text-based format like CSV (comma-separated values) format. This ensures that anyone can use the data, and is required by most data repositories. For instance, we have data from a survey of small mammals in a desert ecosystem. Different people have gone to the field and entered data into a spreadsheet. They keep track of things like species, plot, weight, sex and date collected.\nIf they were to keep track of the data like this:\n\nthe problem is that species and sex are in the same field. So, if they wanted to look at all of one species or look at different weight distributions by sex, it would be hard to do this using this data setup. If instead we put sex and species in different columns, you can see that it would be much easier."

This is part of a project studying the effects of rodents and ants on the plant community that has been running for almost 40 years. The rodents are sampled on a series of 24 plots, with different experimental manipulations controlling which rodents are allowed to access which plots.\nThis is a real dataset that has been used in over 100 publications. We’ve simplified it just a little bit for the workshop, but you can download the full dataset and work with it using exactly the same tools we’ll learn about today.\n\n\nExercise\nWe’re going to take a messy version of the survey data and describe how we would clean it up.\n\nDownload the data by clicking here to get it from FigShare.\nOpen up the data in a spreadsheet program.\nYou can see that there are two tabs. Two field assistants conducted the surveys, one in 2013 and one in 2014, and they both kept track of the data in their own way in tabs 2013 and 2014 of the dataset, respectively. Now you’re the person in charge of this project and you want to be able to start analyzing the data.\nWith the person next to you, identify what is wrong with this spreadsheet. Also discuss the steps you would need to take to clean up the 2013 and 2014 tabs, and to put them all together in one spreadsheet.\n\nImportant Do not forget our first piece of advice: to create a new file (or tab) for the cleaned data, never modify your original (raw) data. After you go through this exercise, we’ll discuss as a group what was wrong with this data and how you would fix it.\nThere are excellent references to help you work with data in spreadsheets.

    "text": "Dates stored as integers\nThe first thing you need to know is that Excel stores dates as numbers - see the last column in the above figure. Essentially, it counts the days from a default of December 31, 1899, and thus stores July 2, 2014 as the serial number 41822.\n(But wait. That’s the default on my version of Excel. We’ll get into how this can introduce problems down the line later in this lesson. )\nThis serial number thing can actually be useful in some circumstances. By using the above functions we can easily add days, months or years to a given date. Say you had a sampling plan where you needed to sample every thirty seven days. In another cell, you could type:\n=B2+37\nAnd it would return\n8-Aug\nbecause it understands the date as a number 41822, and 41822 + 37 = 41859 which Excel interprets as August 8, 2014. It retains the format (for the most part) of the cell that is being operated upon, (unless you did some sort of formatting to the cell before, and then all bets are off). Month and year rollovers are internally tracked and applied.\nNote Adding years and months and days is slightly trickier because we need to make sure that we are adding the amount to the correct entity.\n\nFirst we extract the single entities (day, month or year)\nWe can then add values to do that\nFinally the complete date string is reconstructed using the DATE() function.\n\nAs for dates, times are handled in a similar way; seconds can be directly added but to add hour and minutes we need to make sure that we are adding the quantities to the correct entities.\nWhich brings us to the many different ways Excel provides in how it displays dates. If you refer to the figure above, you’ll see that there are many ways that ambiguity creeps into your data depending on the format you chose when you enter your data, and if you’re not fully aware of which format you’re using, you can end up actually entering your data in a way that Excel will badly misinterpret and you will end up with errors in your data that will be extremely difficult to track down and troubleshoot.\n\nExercise\nWhat happens to the dates in the dates tab of our workbook if we save this sheet in Excel (in csv format) and then open the file in a plain text editor (like TextEdit or Notepad)? What happens to the dates if we then open the csv file in Excel?\n\nNote\nYou will notice that when exporting into a text-based format (such as CSV), Excel will export its internal date integer instead of a useful value (that is, the dates will be represented as integer numbers). This can potentially lead to problems if you use other software to manipulate the file."

Now, we have no doubt this person is highly capable, but I believe time travel was beyond even their grasp.\nEntering dates in one cell is helpful but due to the fact that the spreadsheet programs may interpret and save the data in different ways (doing that somewhat behind the scenes), there is a better practice.\nIn dealing with dates in spreadsheets, separate date data into separate fields (day, month, year), which will eliminate any chance of ambiguity."

    "text": "Problems with Spreadsheets\nSpreadsheets are good for data entry, but in reality we tend to use spreadsheet programs for much more than data entry. We use them to create data tables for publications, to generate summary statistics, and make figures.\nGenerating tables for publications in a spreadsheet is not optimal - often, when formatting a data table for publication, we’re reporting key summary statistics in a way that is not really meant to be read as data, and often involves special formatting (merging cells, creating borders, making it pretty). Cutting and pasting from a spreadsheet to a document software (like Word) can have unpredictable results. We advise you to create tables within these document software using the document’s own table editing software.\nThe latter two applications, generating statistics and figures, should be used with caution: because of the graphical, drag and drop nature of spreadsheet programs, it can be very difficult, if not impossible, to replicate your steps (much less retrace anyone else’s), particularly if your stats or figures require you to do more complex calculations. Furthermore, in doing calculations in a spreadsheet, it’s easy to accidentally apply a slightly different formula to multiple adjacent cells. When using a command-line based statistics program like R or SAS, it’s practically impossible to apply a calculation to one observation in your data set but not another unless you’re doing it on purpose."

Data cleaning also puts your data in a better format prior to importation into a statistical analysis program. We will show you how to use some features of spreadsheet programs to check your data quality along the way and produce preliminary summary statistics.\nIn this lesson, we will assume that you are most likely using Excel as your primary spreadsheet program - there are others (gnumeric, Calc from OpenOffice), and their functionality is similar, but Excel seems to be the program most used by biologists and ecologists.\nIn this lesson we’re going to talk about:\n\nFormatting data tables in spreadsheets\nFormatting problems\nDates as data\nQuality control\nExporting data"

In this activity we are going to add code to catch the drone after it falls (explained in a moment). We are also going to add code to automate the targeting of the drone.\nAirport security is really happy with what you’ve done. The only problem is that when the drones hit the ground they are so mangled that it is hard to figure out who owns it or where it came from. They designed a rolling platform with a net to catch the drone before it can hit the ground. That is going to be a new challenge for the game. Ideally, there would be an automated system to catch the falling drone, so that is something to think about.\nThe other change in this activity is that we are going to use the arrow keys to change the angle of the laser instead of the x,y position of the focus. This is a bit more realistic. This also makes the game a bit harder. Later in the activity we will add code to automatically aim the laser at the drone so it is easier to damage the drones that are encroaching on our airspace."

This example is loosely based on the idea of a “mass spectrometer”. It turns out that if you vaporize a little bit of a sample with some unknown molecules there tends to be alot of molecules that lose ONE electron. Since the molecule has lost an electron it has a +1 charge. The mass of the molecule is essentially the same even if it is missing an electron because electrons make up a very, very small fraction of the mass of atoms. As you will learn about in this lab, the trajectory of the particle in the magnetic field tells us something about the mass of the particle (if you already know q, v, and B for example)."

    "text": "Background information\nThe sun might seem like a simple place where hot plasma radiates and everything stays about the same, but there is quite a bit more to it than that.\nThe surface of the sun is magnetically active. You can see this in the image above from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. At high or low latitudes you can notice the phenomenon of ``aurora borealis”, as many people did in 2024. You can also observe this yourself witha telescope, or a pin-hole solar viewer. Here is an image of the sun from the same day as the image above but at a wavelength that is something you could potentially observe with a solar filter on a small telescope.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dark areas are called “sun spots”. These areas are dark because the magnetic field in those regions is so strong that the magnetic pressure is larger than the gas pressure. Ultimately this causes the region to be slightly colder than othe regions. These dark spots are still blindingly bright, but they are not quite as bright as the surrounding areas so they appear dark when viewed by a telescope with a solar filter.\nThe sun is magnetically active because the plasma in the sun is always moving and this tends to stretch out magnetic field lines and tie them in knots as discussed in this video"

    "text": "Go (safely) observe the sun!\nFind a small telescope, buy a cheap solar filter, and go (safely) observe the sun. KEY OBJECTIVE: How many sunspots can you see!\nAdvice:\n\nConsider asking a local astronomy club for a volunteer to help with this. Odds are they will already have the equipment you need. Or ask a science teacher friend to help.\nThe more expensive solar filters as just as safe as the cheap solar filters. The expensive solar filters show slightly more detail with the sunspots, so they are better if you were going to try to take photographs, but for just looking at the sun and counting the number of sunspots the expensive solar filters aren’t that much better than the inexpensive ones.\nUse the largest (widest diameter, heaviest) eyepiece that you have because these eyepieces zoom out the most, thus making it much easier to put the sun in view. The smaller eyepieces are for zooming in, but because of this it is difficult to use these eyepieces unless you are already precisely aimed at the sun. So maybe just stick with the zoomed out eyepieces for this activity.\nDo NOT use the spotting scope attached to the telescope to help align the telescope with the sun. Instead, look closely at the shadow that your telescope makes, and use that to align the telescope with the sun.\nPut the solar filter on the telescope at the beginning and leave it there until the observing is over. You can align the telescope with the sun even with the solar filter on.\nIf you are worried about aligning the telescope with the sun, you can practice in the evenings by aligning the telescope with the moon (with the solar filter off, obviously). If the moon is bright enough you can use the shadow trick to align the telescope with the moon without the spotting scope.\nIt is possible that the sun will not be very magnetically active on the day that you observe it and perhaps only one or zero sunspots will be visible\n\nAlternative ways to observe sunspots\n\nIf you are less crafty, or it turns out to be cloudy on the day you planned to do all this, then check out the website for NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, look at “The Sun Now” and click through all the different images of the sun\nAnother way to observe the sun is something that people do to observe eclipses called a “box pinhole projector”. Get a cardboard box (larger is better), cut out part of it and place aluminum foil on that part and then use a needle or a paperclip to put a small hole in the aluminum foil. This will produce an image of the sun on the opposite side of the box. It helps to put regular office paper on the side where the image of the sun appears. If the sunspot is large enough, you may be able to see it with this method\nStill another way to observe the sun is using a small telescope and something that some call a “light bucket” or “sun funnel”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA random OSU Marion professor is projecting the sun onto a thin piece of rubber that is attached to a funnel purchased from an auto parts store.\nAn advantage of the light bucket / sun funnel is that students don’t need to look into an eyepiece, consequently you don’t need to worry about the focus being correct for each student (since they will all have different eyesight). A disadvantage is that you can see sunspots but not as clearly as you can with an optical solar filter and an eyepiece. Note that when you use the sun funnel, you do not use a solar filter (which is true of the image above)."

Although daily data is available, there are often days when no measurement was taken, or no sunspots were observed which appear as -1 in the file. The monthly data does not have this issue because there is always at least one sun spot observed.\n\nSteps\n\nClick to download the CSV of the “Monthly mean total sunspot number” or just click this link https://www.sidc.be/SILSO/INFO/snmtotcsv.php\nLoad the CSV file into a spreadsheet program.

According to the number of sunspots observed, how unusual was the magnetic activity during 2024 compared to the magnetic activity that your parents or grandparents may have been able to see when they were growing up?\nWhat do you think the sunspot data will look like over the next few years? Will it be increasing or decreasing?\nIt turns out that when the sun is more active (i.e. when more sunspots are observed) that the earth is slightly hotter, and when the sun is less active (i.e. fewer sunspots are observed) the earth is slightly cooler. For example when there was low sunspot activity in the early 1800s, according to historical records, the earth was slightly cooler than normal. over the past two decades, the earth has been few degrees farenheit warmer than it has typically been compred to data from more than two decades ago. Is it possible that increased solar activity is the cause of the increased temperature of the earth? Has the solar activity over the past two decades been significantly higher, lower or roughly the same as earlier periods of time?"
