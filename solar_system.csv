Sun,0,,
Mercury,57894375961,,Scale (this should be a number larger than 1):
Venus,108159260516,,1
Earth,149597870700,,
Mars,227388763464,,Step 1. Decide on how big your solar system model will be
Jupiter,777908927640,,"for example: football field, basketball court, classroom, etc."
Saturn,1431651622599,,
Uranus,2867791181319,,Step 2. Configure column C so that it takes the value in Column B
Neptune,4514863737726,,and divides it by the scale
Pluto,5906123935236,,
,,,Step 3. Change the scale to make sure that the model distance
,,,to Pluto is roughly the same as the size of your solar system model
