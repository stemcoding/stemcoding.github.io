## Welcome to the STEMcoding Landing Page!

The STEMcoding project is a partnership between [faculty members and students](people.qmd) at [Ohio State University](http://osu.edu) and the [University of Mount Union](http://mountunion.edu)

The STEMcoding project exists to re-imagine introductory STEM courses like math and science with computer science and data science in mind. Our [activities](activities.qmd) are used in intro level college courses and high school courses.

We love to create activities that <b>*each*</b> align with relevant math, [science](http://go.osu.edu/ngss) <b>*and*</b> computer science standards. Some of our physical science activities appear on the "model curriculum" examples distributed by the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce. We are also working to create a year-long data science curriculum.

We are very proud of the [STEMcoding youtube channel!](http://youtube.com/STEMcoding)  We have released over 100 videos featuring faculty and students at Ohio State University and the University of Mount Union.
